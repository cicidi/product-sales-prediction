| `is_holiday`                     | Boosts electronics and clothes sales                    |
| `is_weekend`                     | Boosts food sales significantly                         |
| `product_id`                     | Different base rates, all balanced                      |
| `seller_id`                      | Large sellers have slightly higher volume               |
| `day_of_week`                    | Captures weekday/weekend patterns                       |

Swagger Doc http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#

| name             | Endpoint           | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |

### C.2  Model Context Protocol

Model-Centric Protocol (MCP) is a tool invocation interface provided for large language models (
LLMs), enabling AI models to call various functions through a standardized protocol, such as product
sales analysis and sales prediction.
This API design follows a tool-centric approach, modularizing system functions into independently
callable "tools", allowing large models to flexibly combine and call them based on requirements.

| Endpoint                | Description                                                                      |

## D. Agent + LLM + MCP Integration

LLM agents can be used to provide a natural language interface for querying product sales
predictions.
Functionalities include:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse user queries to identify intent and parameters
- **Tool Invocation**: Call appropriate MCP endpoints based on parsed intent
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation state and context for follow-up questions
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle invalid inputs or API errors
- **Response Generation**: Format API responses into natural language summaries

### D.1 Chatbot Workflow

User types:
> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my best-performing product next week in electronics?‚Äù

Agent thinking Steps:

1. What is the Question ask me to do? -> predict_by_category
2. What is the input? -> { "seller_id": "seller_1", "category": "electronics", "time_range": "next
   week", "top_n": 5 }
3. "Next Week" is not validate input -> "What is the time range?
4. Call "convert_time_range" tool to convert "next week" to a valid time range.
5. Seller ID and category are not provided -> ask user "What is your seller"
6. Fills in missing info (e.g. `seller_id`, `category`)
7. Calls `/mcp/sales/predict`
8. Returns conversational summary with top-N products and explanations
9. If user next more details on product, call `/mcp/sales/manage_product` to get product details

### D.2 LLM API usage

As LLM as high cost and long latency, we need a monitoring to track the usage and performance of LLM
API calls.
By learning from the usage patterns, we can optimize the LLM calls to reduce cost and improve
performance in the following ways:

- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle LLM calls to avoid overuse
- **Chunking**: Understand and Break down large queries into smaller parts to reduce token usage
- **Caching**: Cache common queries and responses to reduce redundant LLM calls

## E. Web UI and Dashboard

Even we have a chatbot interface, we still need a web UI to provide a more visual and interactive.
dashboard for sellers to view and filter predictions.

http://localhost:4200/dashboard
![dashboard.png](documents/dashboard.png)

## F. Identity and Access Management (not implemented yet)

To ensure secure access to the prediction APIs, we need implement an Identity and Access
Management (IAM)

- **Roles and Permissions**: system to control who can access which resources.
- **ClientID** and **ClientSecret**: are used to authenticate the client application, and return *
  *AccessToken**
- **AccessToken**: is a temporary JWT token that contains the user's identity and permissions.

## F. Cost Optimization / Performance & Latency / Accuracy

- LLM agent Cost and performance Optimization
    - User Rag to store and retrieve common queries
    - User Rag to store and retrieve chat history and context , currently use entire chat history,
      but can
      be optimized to only store the last 10 messages.
    - Different model for different user, e.g. use a smaller model for low-traffic sellers. or
      smaller model for convert time range.
    - Use open-source LLMs (e.g. Llama 2, Falcon) for cost-sensitive applications
    - User prompt engineering to reduce token usage, reject irrelevant queries, and avoid
      unnecessary LLM calls, reply message in short and concise.

- Web Service Cost/Latency Optimization
    - Dynamic scaling of microservices based on traffic
    - User Caching.

- Database Cost/Latency Optimization
    - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g. product details, seller metadata)
    - Use database indexing for faster query performance
    - Use partitioning to scale database horizontally
    - Use read replicas to distribute read traffic
- Machine Learning Model accuracy
    - Use XGBoost or LightGBM for structured data
    - Use feature engineering to improve model performance
    - Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
    - Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance
    - Use SHAP values to explain model predictions
    - Early Stopping
    - Online Learning / Active Learning


- Use historical grouping to reduce compute cost for low-traffic sellers
