Hello, my name is Walter Chen. I‚Äôm a Senior Staff Software Engineer with over a decade of experience in backend architecture, AI system integration, and leading large-scale cross-functional initiatives. I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Information Systems and Operations Management from the University of Florida.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve led end-to-end system design and development efforts in various domains such as fintech, real estate tech, and electric vehicles. At PayPal, I spearheaded the Fastlane product from conception to global launch, and Currently, I am primarily responsible for improving engineering productivity in PayPal's merchant integration by adopting AI technologies.

What truly excites me is the intersection of AI and system design. Since 2023, I‚Äôve been deeply involved in AI development ‚Äî I‚Äôve built two personal AI-driven mini apps, one use llm index to build Rag for summarize and search connects from youtubes. I love building practical, scalable systems that bring intelligence into real-time applications. My passion lies in understanding how we can design intelligent agents that interact with users naturally and can reason through structured APIs to deliver business value.

üîπ Professional Achievements (10 minutes)
üèÜ 1. Fastlane End-to-End Development at PayPal
I led the E2E development of the Fastlane checkout product at PayPal ‚Äî from the first design document to global GA rollout. This was a cross-functional effort involving frontend, backend, payment gateways, and legal compliance.

I drove architectural decisions, led sprint planning and delivery, and ensured cross-team alignment across multiple geos. After its launch, Fastlane scaled to serve millions of users, helping significantly improve conversion rates.

One of my proudest moments was driving the Vault optimization initiative as part of Fastlane. Initially, our Vault API success rate was at 99.8%. After a deep investigation into performance bottlenecks and several iterations of design and implementation, I improved the Vault success rate to 99.98%. That 0.18% may seem small, but at PayPal's scale, it translates to thousands of successful user checkouts per day.

üèÜ 2. AI Tool

We are building an AI tool that automatically analyzes JIRA ticket descriptions and application logs to identify the root cause of issues. Once the problem is understood, the system either suggests or directly applies the appropriate fix, and then responds to the JIRA ticket with a detailed resolution summary.

The goal is to significantly reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR), automate repetitive troubleshooting tasks, and allow engineers to focus on more complex and impactful work. By integrating with internal knowledge bases and historical tickets, the tool continuously learns and improves its accuracy over time.

### D.2  Model Context Protocol

Model-Context Protocol (MCP) is a tool invocation interface provided for large language models (
LLMs), enabling AI models to call various functions through a standardized protocol, such as product
sales analysis and sales prediction.
This API design follows a tool-centric approach, modularizing system functions into independently
callable "tools", allowing large models to flexibly combine and call them based on requirements.
[mcp-docs.md](product-sale-prediction-service/src/main/resources/static/mcp-docs.md)

| Endpoint                | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `predict_by_category`   | Predict future Top/Best N sell products within a specific category.              |

Sample Question Supported:

``` 
- List all orders for seller_3 in the last month.
- Predict seller_1's future sales for product p100 in next 10 days.
- What are the details of product ID p101?
- Predict the seller 2 's top 3 selling electronics next week.
- List all products for seller_5.
- Update the price of product ID p300 to 135.0.

## E. Agent + LLM + MCP Integration

LLM agents can be used to provide a natural language interface for querying product sales
predictions.
Functionalities include:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parse user queries to identify intent and parameters
- **Tool Invocation**: Call appropriate MCP endpoints based on parsed intent
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation state and context for follow-up questions
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle invalid inputs or API errors
- **Response Generation**: Format API responses into natural language summaries

![ai_chat_bot.png](documents/ai_chat_bot.png)
<br>
### E.1 Chatbot Workflow

User types:
> "What's my best-performing product next week in electronics?"

Agent thinking Steps:

1. What is the Question ask me to do? -> predict_by_category
2. What is the MCP required input parameter? -> ( seller_id, category, startTime,endTime, top_n)
3. "Next Week" is not validate input -> "What is the time range?"
4. Call "convert_time_range" tool to convert "next week" to a "startTime" + "endTime" range.
5. Seller ID is not provided -> ask user "What is your seller" -> User reply "seller_1"
   -> fill in seller_id
6. But if we just tell LLM "seller_1", AI will ask :"What do you want to do with "seller_1" ? let me check history. 
7. History found, "What's my best-performing product next week in electronics + seller_1 + start/end time". Fills in missing info (e.g. `seller_id`, `category`)
8. Calls `/mcp/sales/predict`
9. Returns conversational summary with top-N products and explanations
10. If user next more details on product, call `/mcp/sales/manage_product` to get product details

### E.2 LLM API usage

As LLM as high cost and long latency, we need a monitoring to track the usage and performance of LLM
API calls.
By learning from the usage patterns, we can optimize the LLM calls to reduce cost and improve
performance in the following ways:

- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle LLM calls to avoid overuse
- **Chunking**: Understand and Break down large queries into smaller parts to reduce token usage
- **Caching**: Cache common queries and responses to reduce redundant LLM calls

## F. Web UI and Dashboard

Even we have a chatbot interface, we still need a web UI to provide a more visual and interactive.
dashboard for sellers to view and filter predictions.

## G. Identity and Access Management (not implemented yet)

To ensure secure access to the prediction APIs, we need implement an Identity and Access
Management (IAM)

- **Roles and Permissions**: system to control who can access which resources.
- **ClientID** and **ClientSecret**: are used to authenticate the client application, and return *
  *AccessToken**
- **AccessToken**: is a temporary JWT token that contains the user's identity and permissions.

## H. Cost Optimization / Performance & Latency / Accuracy

- LLM agent Cost and performance Optimization
    - User Rag to store and retrieve common queries
    - User Rag to store and retrieve chat history and context , currently use entire chat history,
      but can
      be optimized to only store the last 10 messages.
    - Different model for different user, e.g. use a smaller model for low-traffic sellers. or
      smaller model for convert time range.
    - Use open-source LLMs (e.g. Llama 2, Falcon) for cost-sensitive applications
    - User prompt engineering to reduce token usage, reject irrelevant queries, and avoid
      unnecessary LLM calls, reply message in short and concise.

- Web Service Cost/Latency Optimization
    - Dynamic scaling of microservices based on traffic
    - User Caching.

- Database Cost/Latency Optimization
    - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data (e.g. product details, seller metadata)
    - Use database indexing for faster query performance
    - Use partitioning to scale database horizontally
    - Use read replicas to distribute read traffic
- Machine Learning Model accuracy
    - Use XGBoost or LightGBM for structured data
    - Use feature engineering to improve model performance
    - Use hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
    - Use cross-validation to evaluate model performance
    - Use SHAP values to explain model predictions
    - Early Stopping
    - Online Learning / Active Learning

- Use historical grouping to reduce compute cost for low-traffic sellers

## J. Summary

In this project, I have designed and implemented a product sales prediction system for QuickBooks
Commerce. all requirements are met, including:

- Practical AI integration.
- Real-time, explainable outputs
- Scalable microservices and chat interfaces
- Monitoring and fallback strategies for robustness

I have been working very hard on this project, building 4 projects, 27k lines of code by myself, in one
week.

- Used: Java, Python, Angular, Machining Learning, LLM.
- Added: 18829 Deleted: 8637 Total Changed: 27466

```shell
 git log --pretty=tformat: --numstat | grep -E '\.(java|ts|py|md)$' | awk '{ added += $1; deleted += $2 } END { print "Added:", added, "Deleted:", deleted, "Total Changed:", added + deleted }'
```
